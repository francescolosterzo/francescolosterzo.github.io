Hi! I am Francesco, I am a data scientist.

I am a physicist by education, got my PhD as an experimentalist in high energy physics and spent many years working at CERN.  
I then transitioned out of academia (did you ever hear anyting similar!?) and I happily work discover new ways in which data can have an impact on our every day lives.

Outside of work I like to do a lot of stuff: I play guitar, I like reading a lot of different things, I do sports and I like to travel. Also, I always embark myself in new endevours: I am an aspiring Arduino maker and since a while I like building furniture. And who knows what will come next!
