Hi! I am Francesco, I am a data scientist.

I am a physicist by education, got my PhD as an experimentalist in high energy physics and spent many years working at CERN.  
I then transitioned out of academia (did you ever hear anyting similar!?) and I happily work discover new ways in which data can have an impact on our every day lives.

I have been thinking about starting a blog since a while, being inspired by (and often getting help from) many nice blog posts I read. So, let's see how it goes :slightly_smiling_face:!
