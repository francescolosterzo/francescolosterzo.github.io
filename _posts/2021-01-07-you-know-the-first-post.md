Hello! Welcome to my website!
I have been thinking about starting a data/science/data-science/tech/code/whatever blog since a while (like a long while) and now I decided to actually do it.
This blog will be mainly about two things: notes to myself about things that I have to remember and things I find interesting to write about. Posts won’t be regular at all, I don’t even know if there is a blogger/writer inside me :sweat_smile:
